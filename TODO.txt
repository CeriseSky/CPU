include/architecture.hpp:
  - Make the code independent of the machines endianness, the reason it is at
    all is because the loading operations use the machine's endianness

General:
  - Implement RAM and the memory controller
  - Find a use for an address bus
  - Implement the ALU
  - Make the HLT instruction use the ALU to perform the logical OR
  - Make the CPU Turing complete
  - Improve performance (15-20MHz isn't bad but its not that good either)
  - Allow dynamic width instructions
