include/architecture.hpp:
  - Make the code independent of the machines endianness, the reason it is at
    all is because the loading operations use the machine's endianness

General:
  - Write documentation for MMU and ISA
  - Find a use for an address bus
  - Improve performance (15-20MHz isn't bad but its not that good either)
  - Allow dynamic width instructions

Assembly:
  - Write an assembler
  - Add libraries to support the various components (MMU)
